# Description and features of project

Inspiration and/or explain the app (1-3 lines) - Inspiration was a shopping site, many of our future projects could be developing eccommerce sites so having this exposure and practice was the reason for this website. We decided on a book store, as this is a well known industry, and a popular one. 

This app allows you to view books on this website, and then choose the book you want to purchase. You can use this website to view different books and also purchase books of your choice.  

# Wish List

As a bonus we would have added additional products, records, dvds, cd's and more. 
In addition, we would have liked to add book reviews for each of the books as a separate feature. 
Other features on the wish list were comments feature, logout button, delete account feature, subscribe to newsletter and adding items to your cart for review later on.  
Lastly, other main feature we could have added was a subscribe button to the book club where you are notified of upcoming book releases.


# How to use the app

 To use the app you would 1 - view books from the heading "books". You can click on the books you want to purchase and add them to your cart. Click on the buy button and fill in your information to purchase. 

 To purchase items you will need to create account, using the "register" link. Once you have entered a username and password and set up an account you will be able to purchase items. 
 
 Purchase books - Click on "buy button" and then this takes you to the purchase page. 
 Using stripe you can enter your credit card details and then checkout and once checked out, you will receive a confirmation saying thank you for shopping at Book Boulevard.

Our team collaborated on a project called BookBouvard, an online bookstore designed to deliver a user-friendly and inviting experience. We really took pride in the aesthetic aspects of our design. To achieve this, we initiated the project by constructing the front-end using the React framework and fine-tuned the visual presentation using CSS to optimize the user experience. Our application is accessible through web browsers and mobile devices, with responsive design to accommodate various screen sizes. To enhance the functionality of our application, we integrated several React libraries, including react-cookies and react-hot-toaster, to implement features like pop-up notifications. Additionally, we integrated technologies like STRIPE to streamline the user experience for adding items to the cart and completing purchases. Extensive testing was conducted, including the use of test credit card data, which yielded successful results. Thirdly, we introduced user authentication to our app , allowing users to create accounts for a seamless checkout experience. Shanon is going to tell us a little bit about that and the back-end of our app! Our collaborative development process consisted of more than 147 commits. To avoid overwriting each other's work, we created individual branches and maintained constant communication via Discord. As we reached the final stages, we forked the repository and individually worked on deploying the application. This decision stemmed from our desire to gain practical experience in deployment, as well runnning out of time in our classroom environment. The deployment was executed on Render.
