# Description and features of project

Inspiration and/or explain the app (1-3 lines) - Inspiration was a shopping site, many of our future projects could be developing eccommerce sites so having this exposure and practice was the reason for this website. We decided on a book store, as this is a well known industry, and a popular one. 

This app allows you to view books on this website, and then choose the book you want to purchase. You can use this website to view different books and also purchase books of your choice.  

# Wish List

As a bonus we would have added additional products, records, dvds, cd's and more. 
In addition, we would have liked to add book reviews for each of the books as a separate feature. 
Other features on the wish list were comments feature, logout button, delete account feature, subscribe to newsletter and adding items to your cart for review later on.  
Lastly, other main feature we could have added was a subscribe button to the book club where you are notified of upcoming book releases.


# How to use the app

 To use the app you would 1 - view books from the heading "books". You can click on the books you want to purchase and add them to your cart. Click on the buy button and fill in your information to purchase. 

 To purchase items you will need to create account, using the "register" link. Once you have entered a username and password and set up an account you will be able to purchase items.
