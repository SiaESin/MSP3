# Description and features of project

Inspiration and/or explain the app (1-3 lines) - Inspiration was a shopping site, many of our future projects could be developing eccommerce sites so having this exposure and practice was the reason for this website. We decided on a book store, as this is a well known industry, and a popular one. 

This app allows you to view books on this website, and then choose the book you want to purchase. You can use this website to view different books and also subscribe to the book club where you are notified of upcoming book releases. 

# Wish List

As a bonus we may want to add additional products, records, dvds, cd's and more. 
In addition if we had more time, we would have liked to add book reviews for each of the books as a separate feature. 
To add reviews section of the site! Adding comments feature.
